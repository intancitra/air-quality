# Air Quality Dashboard âœ¨

## Introduction

This Streamlit dashboard provides insights into air quality data collected from multiple stations in Beijing. The data includes various air quality metrics such as PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and more. The dashboard allows users to explore the data based on different criteria and visualizes key aspects of air quality.
